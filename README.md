Hi I'm Elliot Lassey, a 2nd year student in   KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (KNUST)
I love coding, drawing and touch typing.
I have been coding for two years now. 
I love anime, I love one Piece and I love Naruto as well. Those are the best anime in existence in my own opinion.
I am proficient in JavaScript, python, react, node and express
I am interested in web development. My goal is to become a fullstack developer and I am currently having a taste of both 
sides of the web although I am a bit slightly more biased towards backend development and working with express js and mongo DB(node development)

I'm still learning express mongoose and mongo DB
I have a good grasp of html, css, jss and react js
I look forward to developing projects and a good grasp of python Django and sql for backend
